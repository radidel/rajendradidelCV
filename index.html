        <h1><strong>A Kubernetes Story: Benny Goes to the Zoo</strong></h1>

        <blockquote>
        <p>
            Once upon a time in the world of technology, there lived a curious little creature named <strong>Benny</strong>. Benny wasn't like the other animals in the forest; Benny was a <strong>container</strong>. Benny lived in a tiny <strong>container</strong> village nestled between the towering trees of the <strong>Cloud Forest</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
            One sunny morning, <strong>Benny</strong> woke up with a sense of adventure. 
            
             <p> “I’m bored Aunt Benny,” <strong>Zara</strong> further down on the couch.  </p>
             <p> <img src="0pods.jpg" alt="Benny at the Kubernetes Zoo" width="300" height="200"></p>
                <p>  “What are we going to do today?” </p>
                    <p>  “Why not go see the animals?” said Benny with a smile. “We’ll go to the zoo!” </p>
                        <p>  “Yeah!” Zara let out a whoop and ran to find some shoes.</p>

            

            It had heard tales of a magical place called the <strong>Kubernetes Zoo</strong>. The <strong>Kubernetes Zoo</strong> was known far and wide as the most amazing place for <strong>containers</strong> to live and thrive. <strong>Benny</strong> decided it was time to pay the zoo a visit.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            <blockquote>
            <p> The first animals they came upon were the size of squirrels. Furry and blue, each little animal carried a tiny box 
            as they unceasingly zipped back and forth. </p>
                    <p>“Those,” said Benny, “are Pods. All day and all night, they run back and forth carrying their little containers.” </p>
                        <p>“Is that all they do, Aunt Benny?” </p>
                            <p>“Yup, Zara. For their entire lives, that’s all the Pods do. They run.”</p>

            </blockquote>        
                <blockquote>
                    <p>
                        In Kubernetes, <strong>Pods</strong> are responsible for running your containers. Every Pod holds at least one container, 
and controls the execution of that container. When the containers exit, the Pod dies too.

                    </p>
                </blockquote>

        </p>

        <p>
            Benny and Zara found a bunch of meerkats behind glass. These meerkats were like <strong>"ReplicaSets"</strong> in Kubernetes.
        </p>
        <p> <img src="3.jpeg" alt="Benny at the Kubernetes Zoo" width="300" height="200"></p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>
            
            One meerkat on the right jumped off, and the others quickly moved to fill the gap. Then, a new meerkat appeared on the left. This happened every time one meerkat left.
        </p>
        <p>
            Benny explained, "Just like these meerkats, <strong>ReplicaSets</strong> in Kubernetes always make sure there are a certain number of identical pods running. If one pod stops working, Kubernetes replaces it with a new one. It's all about keeping things running smoothly."
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Zara got it. "So, when one meerkat goes, another comes in, like a team. Cool!"

Benny and Zara walked away, understanding how Kubernetes ensures things stay reliable, just like those clever meerkats.

        drops off, the ReplicaSet brings a new one online as a replacement</a></li>

        <p>
            <blockquote>
               <p>Walking further, Benny pointed out a clump of burrows and warrens. While there were plenty of signs that the area was inhabited, neither Zara nor Benny could see a single movement.</p> 

                <p>"The Enchanted <strong>Secrets</strong> are in here," said Zara. "but you can't see them without these decoder glasses."</p>
                <p> <img src="9.jpg" alt="Benny at the Kubernetes Zoo" width="300" height="200"></p>
                <p>Benny took the pair of glasses Zara offered, slid them on, and blushed. "Oh, my. I think I'm ready to go on now, Aunt Zara." Benny handed back the glasses, and onward they went.</p>

          <li><a><strong>Secrets</strong> are used to store non-public information, such as tokens, certificates, or passwords. Secrets can 
be attached to Pods at runtime so that sensitive configuration data can be stored securely in the cluster
          </a></li>

        <blockquote>
           <p>Picture a group of playful lemurs gathered by a massive slingshot at the edge of a pond. In the center of the pond, there's a small island. One daring lemur hops into the slingshot, while the others pull it back and then release, sending the lemur soaring towards the island.</p> 
           <p> <img src="7.jpg" alt="Benny at the Kubernetes Zoo" width="300" height="200"></p>
        <p>Zara explained, <strong>"Deployments</strong> in Kubernetes work a bit like this. They send a bunch of things, just like these lemurs, to a specific place, which, in this case, is the island. Right now, they're trying to get three of them over there."</p>
        <p>Right at that moment, another lemur was shot into the air but missed the island, creating a big splash in the pond.</p>
        <p>Zara continued, "If they miss the target, they keep trying until they get as many as they need on the island."</p>
        <p>So, in Kubernetes, <strong>Deployments</strong> ensure that the right number of things are where they should be, much like these lemurs' repeated attempts to reach the island.</p>

                    A <strong>Deployment </strong> is a higher-order abstraction that controls deploying and maintaining a set of <strong>Pods</strong>. Behind the scenes, it uses a <strong>ReplicaSet</strong> to keep the Pods running, but it offers sophisticated logic for deploying, updating, and scaling a set of Pods within a cluster.

            <blockquote>
                <p>Benny and Zara came across a grassy knoll with several tall stone pillars, each hosting a vulture on its top. As they observed, one vulture spread its wings and flew away into the distance. Surprisingly, as soon as one vulture left, another one quickly landed to take its place.</p>
                <p> <img src="8.jpg" alt="Benny at the Kubernetes Zoo" width="300" height="200"></p>
                <p><a>Curious, Zara asked, "What are they doing?"</a></p>
                <p>Benny explained, "Those are like <strong> DaemonSets </strong>in Kubernetes. They make sure to always have a vulture on every pillar, no matter what the weather or time of day is."</p>
                <p>Benny grinned and added, "I'm willing to bet that if we added a new pillar, a new vulture would land on it faster than you could say 'cube cuddle.'"</p>
                <p>Just like those vultures reliably occupy every pillar,<strong> DaemonSets</strong> in Kubernetes ensure that a specific kind of <strong>pod</strong> is running on every node in a cluster, regardless of any changes or disruptions.</p>

                <a>
                   <strong>DaemonSets </strong>provide a way to ensure that a copy of a Pod is running on every node in the cluster. As a cluster grows and shrinks, the DaemonSet spreads these specially labeled Pods across all of the nodes.
